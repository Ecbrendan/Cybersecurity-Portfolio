##### 1Ô∏è‚É£ EICAR Test File ‚Äì Antivirus Testing

##### üîç Description:
The [EICAR test string](https://www.eicar.org/?page_id=3950) is a harmless file designed to test the response of antivirus software.

##### üìÑ File: [`eicar_test_file.txt`](./eicar_test_file.txt)
This file is a `.txt` version of the standard `eicar.com` test file to avoid automatic antivirus flags or GitHub restrictions.

##### üß™ How to Test:
1. Copy and paste this string into a text editor:
X5O!P%@AP[4\PZX54(P^)7CC)7}$EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!$H+H*

2. Save as `eicar.com`
3. Your antivirus should immediately detect and quarantine it
