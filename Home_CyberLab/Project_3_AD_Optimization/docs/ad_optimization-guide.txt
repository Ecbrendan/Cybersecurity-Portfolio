Setup and guide for Active Directory Optimization, covering:

Creating Organizational Units (OUs)

Implementing Group Policy Objects (GPOs) for:

Password complexity

Login banners

Software restriction policies

1: Create Proper OUs
âœ… Objective: Organize Active Directory into logical units for easier management and GPO targeting.

ðŸ”§ Steps:

Log in to your Domain Controller (Windows Server 2022) as a domain admin.

Open Server Manager â†’ Click Tools â†’ Open Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC).

In the left pane, right-click your domain name (e.g deelabserver.com) â†’ Select New â†’ Organizational Unit.

Create the following OUs one after the other:

- Workstations

- Servers

- Users

- Guests

Move existing domain-joined computers and user accounts into appropriate OUs:

- Move domain-joined Windows clients to Workstations

- Move the Domain Controller to Servers

- Move users into Users or Guests depending on roles

2: Group Policy â€“ Enforce Password Complexity
âœ… Objective: Ensure strong password policies are enforced domain-wide.

ðŸ”§ Steps:

Open Group Policy Management:
Server Manager â†’ Tools â†’ Group Policy Management

Right-click the Default Domain Policy under your domain â†’ Click Edit.

In the GPO Editor:

Computer Configuration â†’ Policies â†’ Windows Settings â†’ Security Settings â†’ Account Policies â†’ Password Policy

Enforce password history: 24 passwords remembered

Maximum password age: 90 days (or lower for stricter rotation)

Minimum password length: 8

Password must meet complexity requirements: Enabled

Close the editor. The policy will apply at the domain level.

3: Group Policy â€“ Configure Login Banner
âœ… Objective: Display a legal or warning message before users log in.

ðŸ”§ Steps:
In Group Policy Management, right-click the OU (e.g., Users) â†’ Create a New GPO named Login Banner Policy.

Right-click the new GPO â†’ Click Edit.

Navigate to:

Computer Configuration â†’ Policies â†’ Windows Settings â†’ Security Settings â†’ Local Policies â†’ Security Options

Set:

Interactive logon: Message title for users attempting to log on â†’ WARNING: Authorized Users Only

Interactive logon: Message text for users attempting to log on â†’ This system is for the use of authorized individuals only. Unauthorized access or use is prohibited and may be subject to disciplinary or legal action.

Link this GPO to the Users OU (or the whole domain if you want it everywhere).

4: Group Policy â€“ Software Restriction Policies
âœ… Objective: Prevent users from running unauthorized programs (e.g., .exe from USBs or Downloads).

ðŸ”§ Steps:
In Group Policy Management, right-click the Workstations OU â†’ Create a GPO named Software Restriction Policy.

Edit the GPO â†’ Navigate to:

Computer Configuration â†’ Policies â†’ Windows Settings â†’ Security Settings â†’ Software Restriction Policies
Right-click Software Restriction Policies â†’ New Software Restriction Policies.

Set the Security Level:

Right-click Disallowed â†’ Set as Default

Create New Path Rules to allow trusted paths, such as:

C:\Program Files\* â†’ Security Level: Unrestricted

C:\Windows\* â†’ Unrestricted

\\domaincontroller\netlogon\* â†’ Unrestricted (optional, for login scripts)

You may add:

%HOMEPATH%\Downloads\* â†’ Disallowed

%USERPROFILE%\AppData\* â†’ Disallowed

Link this GPO to the Workstations OU.

Note that this could disable some systems apps.


In Group Policy Management, right-click the Workstations OU â†’ Create a GPO named Software Restriction Policy.

Edit the GPO â†’ Navigate to:

Computer Configuration â†’ Administrative Templates â†’ System â†’ Removeable Storage Access.

Select removeable storage access in the left pane. In the right pane, double click and enable the following:

	i. Removeable Disk: Deny execute access
	ii. Removeable Disk: Deny read access
	iii. Removeable Disk: Deny write access

 

ðŸ”„ Force GPO Update and Test
âœ… Objective: Apply and verify GPO effectiveness.

ðŸ”§ Steps:
On any client or server machine, run:

gpupdate /force

Reboot or log off/log on to test if

- Login banner is shown

- Password rules enforced when changing passwords

- Unauthorized apps fail to run from Downloads or USB

- Removeable drive is restricted from executing on the system.
