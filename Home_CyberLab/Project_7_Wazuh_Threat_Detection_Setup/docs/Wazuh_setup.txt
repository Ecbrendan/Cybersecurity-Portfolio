2. Install Wazuh (Manager + Dashboard + Filebeat) on Ubuntu

- For this lab, I am using the latest version of Wazuh which is currently 4.12. 

- I'll be installing using the assisted installation method and as a single node.

- This steps may differ for other versions. and you can please following the steps provided on the site.  

Go to https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/installation-guide/wazuh-indexer/index.html.


2.1 Wazuh indexer cluster installation

Create a directory and open it. 

mkdir Wazuh 
cd Wazuh

2.1.1 Download the Wazuh installation assistant and the configuration file.

curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.12/wazuh-install.sh
curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.12/config.yml

2.1.2 Edit ./config.yml and replace the node names and IP values with the corresponding names and IP addresses.

nodes:
  # Wazuh indexer nodes
  indexer:
    - name: node-1
      ip: "192.168.10.20"
    #- name: node-2
    #  ip: "<indexer-node-ip>"
    #- name: node-3
    #  ip: "<indexer-node-ip>"

  # Wazuh server nodes
  # If there is more than one Wazuh server
  # node, each one must have a node_type
  server:
    - name: wazuh-1
      ip: "192.168.10.20"
    #  node_type: master
    #- name: wazuh-2
    #  ip: "<wazuh-manager-ip>"
    #  node_type: worker
    #- name: wazuh-3
    #  ip: "<wazuh-manager-ip>"
    #  node_type: worker

  # Wazuh dashboard nodes
  dashboard:
    - name: dashboard
      ip: "12.168.10.20"

2.1.3 Run the Wazuh installation assistant with the option --generate-config-files to generate the Wazuh cluster key, certificates, and passwords necessary for installation.

bash wazuh-install.sh --generate-config-files

2.1.4 Run the Wazuh installation assistant with the option --wazuh-indexer and the node name to install and configure the Wazuh indexer. The node name must be the same one used in config.yml

bash wazuh-install.sh --wazuh-indexer node-1

2.1.5 Run the Wazuh installation assistant with option --start-cluster on any Wazuh indexer node to load the new certificates information and start the cluster.

bash wazuh-install.sh --start-cluster

2.1.6 Testing the cluster installation
Run the following command to get the admin password:

tar -axf wazuh-install-files.tar wazuh-install-files/wazuh-passwords.txt -O | grep -P "\'admin\'" -A 1

2.1.7 Run the following command to confirm that the installation is successful. Replace <ADMIN_PASSWORD> with the password gotten from the output of the previous command. Replace <WAZUH_INDEXER_IP> with the configured Wazuh indexer IP address:

curl -k -u admin:<ADMIN_PASSWORD> https://<WAZUH_INDEXER_IP>:9200

2.1.8 Replace <WAZUH_INDEXER_IP> and <ADMIN_PASSWORD>, and run the following command to check if the cluster is working correctly:

curl -k -u admin:<ADMIN_PASSWORD> https://<WAZUH_INDEXER_IP>:9200/_cat/nodes?v

The Wazuh indexer is now successfully installed.

2.2.1 Run the Wazuh installation assistant with the option --wazuh-server followed by the node name to install the Wazuh server. The node name must be the same one used in config.yml

bash wazuh-install.sh --wazuh-server wazuh-1

2.3.1 Run the Wazuh installation assistant with the option --wazuh-dashboard and the node name to install and configure the Wazuh dashboard. The node name must be the same one used in config.yml

bash wazuh-install.sh --wazuh-dashboard dashboard

Once the Wazuh installation is completed, the output shows the access credentials and a message that confirms that the installation was successful.
