Goal: Replace MikroTik with OPNsense

Network Architecture with OPNsense

- All devices route through OPNsense

- OPNsense relays DHCP to Windows Server

- OPNsense acts as a bridge between Subnets

- OPNsense enforces firewall policies


Step-by-Step Migration Plan

1. Prepare and install the OPNsense VM
vNIC	VMware Network	Purpose				OPNsense Name		IP / Mask
1	Bridge 		ISP-facing bridged		WAN			WAN	DHCP
2	VMnet2		192.168.10.0/24 segment		LAN			192.168.10.1 /24
3	VMnet3		192.168.20.0/24 segment		OPT1			192.168.20.1 /24


After the installer reboots, log in at the console with (installer/opnsense) and install to disk 
After reboot login with (root/opnsense) and run Option 1 to assign these interfaces.


2. Web-GUI initialisation

Browse to https://192.168.10.1 (default LAN IP) → log in (root / opnsense)

System → Wizard

Change the root password

Enter hostname, DNS, and time-zone (Africa/Lagos)

Interfaces → LAN

Confirm Static IPv4 = 192.168.10.1/24 → Save → Apply

Interfaces → OPT1

Tick Enable

Static IPv4 = 192.168.20.1/24

No DHCP (Windows Server will supply) → Save → Apply

3. Set up DHCP Relay to Windows Server (192.168.10.10)
Services → DHCRelay

Create Destination servers: Name: Windows Server, Address: 192.168.10.10

Create Relay, 
Tick: enable
Interface: OPT1
Destination: Windows Server
Save → Apply

Windows Server checklist (This is already configured in the previous project)

Two active scopes:

192.168.10.0/24 – Router option 003 = 192.168.10.1

192.168.20.0/24 – Router option 003 = 192.168.20.1

Authorised in AD DS

DHCP service running

4. Outbound NAT (internet access)
Firewall → NAT → Outbound

Select Automatic (includes both internal subnets)

Save → Apply

5. Base firewall rules

LAN
Rule 1  Allow  *  LAN net → any   (this is created by default)

OPT1 (copy of LAN rule so those clients can get online)
Rule 1  Allow  *  OPT1 net → any

This can later be tighten to our taste.

6. DNS behavior (This was achieved in step 2 when we configured hostname, DNS, and time-zone)
If Windows Server (192.168.10.10) is already the DNS for your domain, point OPNsense to it:

System → Settings → General → DNS Servers: 192.168.10.10

Services → Unbound DNS → General: disable Enable DNS Resolver (or leave enabled but add 192.168.10.10 as an upstream).

Make sure both DHCP scopes hand out DNS = 192.168.10.10.


7. Testing matrix

Test	

- Ping 192.168.10.1 from a 10-network client	
- Ping 192.168.20.1 from a 20-network client	
- ipconfig /renew on 20-network client
- nslookup www.google.com on any client
- Browse to the internet from both networks


Goal:
Allow domain users to authenticate through OPNsense using RADIUS (Windows NPS), just like before.

1. Ensure Windows NPS is Configured
We’ve already done this on your Windows Server 2022. Confirm:

✅ NPS Configuration Recap
NPS Role installed

A RADIUS client (MikroTik) was added before — now replace it with OPNsense

Connection Request Policy & Network Policy are in place

Server has shared secret defined - Radiuslab

- If this hasn't been done or you are building with OPNsense directly for the first time

Configure NPS (Windows Server)

Step 1: Add RADIUS Client

Open Network Policy Server

Right-click RADIUS Clients → New

Friendly name: OPNsense

Address: 192.168.10.1 (OPNsense LAN IP)

Shared secret: e.g., Radiuslab


Step 2: Create a Connection Request Policy

Go to Policies → Connection Request Policies

Right-click → New

Name: OPNsense Login

Conditions: Client Friendly Name = OPNsense

Authentication: Authenticate requests on this server

Step 3: Create a Network Policy

Go to Policies → Network Policies

Right-click → New

Name: OPNsense Admin Login

Conditions:

Windows Groups: Add your OPNsenseAdmins group

Grant access: ✅ Allow

Authentication methods: PAP (OPNsense only supports PAP for GUI)

Constraints: Uncheck MS-CHAPv2, leave PAP

Click Ok


On OPNsense

1. Create a RADIUS Authentication Server on OPNsense

Go to: System → Access → Servers → Add

Field			Value
Type			RADIUS
Name			Windows-NPS
Hostname or IP Address	192.168.10.10
Authentication Port	1812
Accounting Port		1813
Shared Secret		Radiuslab
Scope			Authentication and Accounting
Default groups		Admins 	
Automatic user creation	Check
Protocol		PAP
Save	✅

2. Add RADIUS to the Authentication Sources

Go to: System → Settings → Administration

Under Authentication Server:

Choose: Local Database + Windows-NPS

Sudo: 	Ask password 	

Click Save

✅ Done: 

3. Test Web Login with RADIUS

Open a browser → https://192.168.10.1

Login as: domainuser

Password: your domain password

✅ You should now have full web UI access.

Now, members of the AD group can log into OPNsense with their domain credentials.
